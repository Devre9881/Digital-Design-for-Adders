# Digital-Design-for-Adders
This project focuses on the design and implementation of various digital adder architectures used in high-speed arithmetic circuits. The main objective was to analyze and optimize the performance of adders in terms of speed, area, and power efficiency.

Different types of adders — such as Half Adder, Full Adder, Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA), and Carry Select Adder (CSLA) — were designed and simulated using Verilog HDL. Each design was verified functionally and compared based on delay, hardware complexity, and scalability for higher bit-widths.

The project highlights how optimized logic design techniques and hierarchical carry computation can significantly reduce propagation delay, making them suitable for high-performance digital systems such as processors, DSPs, and ALUs.

Overall, the work demonstrates the importance of efficient digital design in improving computational throughput while minimizing hardware resources.
